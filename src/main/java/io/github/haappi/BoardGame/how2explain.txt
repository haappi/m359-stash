what's a hashmap
- your key is "hash"ed to a number (hence the name hashmap)
- the number hash is used to index into an array
- this array is very fast to access, and doesn't have to traverse the entire array to find the value
- however, you can only store one value per key
- think of two arraylists alongside each other, but all duplicates removed for the key arraylist
- - and you just match the index of the key to the index of the value arraylist


getOrDefault()
- usually we use `get`, but if the key doesn't exist, it returns null
- and im too lazy to check for null
- so i use getOrDefault, which takes in a default value to return if the key doesn't exist
- no null checks for me!!!

extends thing
- this is inheritance. you "inherit" all the methods/attributes from the parent class
- you can access all methods of the parent class in the child class
- you can also override methods of the parent class in the child class

var keyword
- automatically infers the type of the variable
- so you don't have to type out the type of the variable
- var wrapper = new Object(){ String value = ""; };
- - this is a wrapper class that holds a string

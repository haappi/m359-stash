Fibonacci sequence-
Make an array or a string with a seperator of some sort
add 2 elements by default; 0, 1
loop through the array and add the last 2 elements together
add the new element to the array
repeat until user input + 2 (because of the 2 elements added by default)

x number oif multiples of y
just a basic for loop, starting at 0, going up to x + 1, and adding y to the counter each time
> or i can just multiply by the counter

print substrings of a number
convert the number to a string
- use a double for loop to loop through the string
- the outer loop will be the starting index
- the inner loop will be the ending index
it would increment by 1 each time, thus leading to each substring being printed
THIS WON'T PRINT ALL PERMUTATIONS OF THE STRING.

prime factoraization
integer division the number by all single digit prime numbers until all things are single digits prime numbers

Strong numbers:
convert the number to a string
loop through the string
raise each digit to the length of the string (Math.pow)
add the result to a counter
if the counter is equal to the number, then it is a strong number

Armstrong / Narcissistic numbers:
convert the number to a string
loop through the string
cube each digit
see if they all add up to the number
if it does, then it is an armstrong number
